PHP's emphasis is on getting the job done, quickly, not cleverness. That's not to say that you cam't write nice, clean, object-oriented code in PHP. I think that where most PHP programmers go wrong is in thinking that because you can embed PHP in HTML, that you must do so. My own PHP code is strongly object oriented and contains no embedded code at all (apart from the initial page).
